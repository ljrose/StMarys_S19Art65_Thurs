# Blog:
This is my blog, feel free to read it if you would like, I am more than happy to answer any questions that you might have :D

# Project
My Project idea is stated on the second entry of my blog. It is essentially to create an interactive website that can generate fractals based upon the user's inputs. This would be done to help users understand how different fractal algos work. They would be able to (hopefully) pick from 1-3 equations (each generates a unique fractal) and would be able to customize their fractal by changing certain variables to whatever they want. This project will use HTML, CSS, and JS.
