            <td class="text">An interactive website where the user can learn about fractals and watch them get created in real time. The user will pick which type of fractal they would like to create, as well as some parameters that are needed to help create the fractal, and will watch as the fractal is constructed for them in real time.</td>

            <td class="first">What does this have to do with art?</td>
            <td class="text">I like to believe that math is beautiful, and while I hold the belief that equations have beauty, I feel that a more visual representation of beauty in mathematics might be more appealing to my target audience. The design and execution of the creation of the fractals will comprise the artistic component of my project.</td>
