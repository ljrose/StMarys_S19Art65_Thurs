          <span class="tab">This is my first blog post.</span> This week I transfered into the class and started on my blog. I have been making websites for about two years and have won a hackathon event using a website that I created over the weekend. I am very passionate about writing code and making computers do my bidding. I also think that cyber security is cool and that math is fun. I am excited to hopefully help y'all make websites that you will be proud of. Here is a list of what I am working on:


          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list"><span class="bullet"></span><span class="text">Making a GitHub Repo</span></li>
            <li class="list"><span class="bullet"></span><span class="text">Reminding myself how to make websites</span></li>
            <li class="list"><span class="bullet"></span><span class="text">Practicing making websites with colors besides black and white :D</span></li>
          </ul>
